# unzip-all
unzips every .zip in a folder

## How to install
1. Download [installer.sh](https://github.com/Deadibone/unzip-all/releases/download/1.0/installer.sh)
2. go to the location where the script is downloaded
3. run ```chmod +x installer.sh```
4. run ```sudo ./installer.sh```


## Usage

```
unzip_all [-d] [-h]
  -d    Delete the ZIP files after unzipping.
  -h    Display this help message.

## Why did I write this shell script
Because I have too many zip files

## Is this useless?
Technically yes, because you can just run ```unzip "*.zip"```

BUT, this program can delete the zip files too!
